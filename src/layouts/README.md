# Layouts

This directory contains source files for the layouts used by a specific route or page. It is basically the wrapper and the parent div of a page.

#### Application

Let's say you have a sidebar and a navbar that you want to be present in all pages of a route. You can create a layout that contains both of them and then use that layout in all pages of that route.
